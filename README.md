# Flutter Event Channel Integration Tutorial

This repository contains the complete source code for integrating **Event Channels** in Flutter, enabling real-time data streaming between Flutter and native Android/iOS platforms.

## **Overview**

Event channels in Flutter allow continuous streaming of data from native code (Android/iOS) to Dart. Perfect for scenarios like:

- Device sensor updates
- Real-time data tracking
- Streaming live event notifications

## **Tutorial Highlights**

1. **Dart Implementation**: Learn how to define and listen to `EventChannel` streams in your Flutter app.
2. **Android Native Code**: Kotlin implementation for sending continuous data streams to Flutter.
3. **iOS Native Code**: Swift implementation to handle real-time updates for your Flutter app.

## **Getting Started**

### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kotlincodes/flutter_event_channel_demo
cd event-channel-demo
```

### **Run the Project**
1. Ensure Flutter is installed on your system.
2. Launch an emulator or connect a device.
3. Use the following command:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
